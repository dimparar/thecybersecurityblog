Let's scan with nmap.

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
3000/tcp open  ppp?
```

Modify the `/etc/hosts` file by adding `10.10.11.25 greenhorn.htb` so the browser can skip the DNS resoltion. Now we can access the domain. 

As we can see, there is an http service running at port 80 and an undefined service running at port 3000. Let's start with the http server.

Proceed to enumerate web directories with `ffuf`. By executing `ffuf -u http://greenhorn:80/FUZZ -w <wordlist>` we get a lot of responses with `status code 302 (redirected)`, so let's add `-r` to follow redirects. Then the most responses have `length 2245`. It seems that if the directory doesn't exist, we get redirected to the home page, so add `-fs 2245` to filter those.

```bash
# Enumerate directories
# use -r flag to follow redirects
# use -fs 2245 to filter responses with length 2245
ffuf -u http://greenhorn:80/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -r -fs 2445
```

We got an `admin.php` page that redirects us to `login.php`, but we do not have the password yet. 

![alt](lab11.png)

The applcation running is Pluck, a small and simple content management system, written in php. By searching `pluck 4.7.18 exploit site:github.com` we get [CVE-2023-50564 (PoC)](https://github.com/Rai2en/CVE-2023-50564_Pluck-v4.7.18_PoC). Unfortunately, the exploit requires login credentials to work.

Let's try the service at port 3000.

![alt](lab3.png)

```bash
ffuf -u http://greenhorn:3000/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -r
```

By checking `sitemap.xml`, we found `http://greenhorn.htb:3000/explore/repos/sitemap-1.xml`.

`http://greenhorn.htb:3000/sitemap.xml`:

`http://greenhorn.htb:3000/explore/repos/sitemap-1.xml`:
![alt](lab6.png)
<br>

Let's check this repository `GreenAdmin/GreenHorn`

As we can see the password check for the login is done by a hash function that is taking as parameters the type of encryption, `sha512` and the varible, `$cont1`.

By searching the repository files we can also find the password hash at `data/settings/pass.php` file.

![alt](lab9.png)

We know the hash and the encryption method, so we can decrypt it now.

![alt](lab10.png)

Use this password at `http://greenhorn:80/login.php`.

Great it works, so now we can use the exploit we found before.
By following the `README` instructions, we created the `payload.zip` file with the payload.

```bash
nc -lnvp 6464 # Start a listener

python3 ./exploit.py # Run the script and enter the .zip file path when prompted
```

Nice, we got the reverse shell. But still, we are `www-data` user and the shell is unstable. We need escalate our previleges to a user and then to root.

```bash
export TERM=xterm # can use commands like clear now

python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' # to spawn a bash shell
```

Let's by checking the users with `cat /etc/passwd | grep home`. We got a user named `junior`. Maybe the password works for him too, `su junior`. We got a foothold!
![alt](lab12.png)

Now let's go for the root. Checking basic things like `sudo -l`, `crontab` etc didn't lead anywhere, so let's transfer `/home/junior/Using OpenVAS.pdf` file to our machine in order to inpect it.

By opening it with a Pdf Reader we can see a message by Mr. Green.

One way to find out the password is to use a tool called [Depix](https://github.com/spipm/Depix). To use this tool we need to give as a parameter the target `.png` and a search image. Unfortunately, if we take a screenshot of the pixelized password, the tool isn't working as expected.

Notice that there is another tool, `tool_show_boxed`, that we can use to check if the our image is valid.

![alt](lab14.png)

Since taking a screenshot isn't working let's use an internet tool to extract images from pdf.

```bash
# Check if the image is valid
python3 ./tool_show_boxes.py -p extracted_image.png -s images/searchimages/debruinseq_notepad_Windows10_closeAndSpaced.png
```
![alt](lab15.png)

```bash
# Depixelize the image
python3 ./depix.py -p extracted_image.png -s images/searchimages/debruinseq_notepad_Windows10_closeAndSpaced.png
```
![alt](lab16.png)

Now `su root`, type the password and ... we are root.
